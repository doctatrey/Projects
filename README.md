# Project Portfolio

Hi! I'm Trey, a student currently pursuing **Cybersecurity and AI**. This portfolio will showcase web development projects I built while learning programming fundamentals and working with APIs, data storage, and interactive applications.

## Technologies & Skills

- **Languages:** JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Python
- **Concepts:** API integration, localStorage, DOM manipulation, game logic, asynchronous operations
- **Tools:** Git, GitHub, REST APIs

## Featured Projects

### [Wordle Clone](https://github.com/doctatrey/wordle-clone)
Browser-based word guessing game with color-coded feedback system. Implements game state management, string comparison algorithms, and win/loss condition logic.



### [To-Do List App](https://github.com/doctatrey/todo-list-app)
Task management application with persistent storage using localStorage API. Demonstrates CRUD operations and state management with data surviving browser sessions.



### [Weather Dashboard](https://github.com/doctatrey/weather-dashboard)
Real-time weather application fetching live data from external API. Displays current conditions with error handling and dynamic content rendering.



### [NATO Phonetic Converter](https://github.com/doctatrey/nato-phonetic-converter)
Utility tool converting text into NATO phonetic alphabet (A → Alpha, B → Bravo). Demonstrates string manipulation and practical problem-solving for clear communication.



### [Tic-Tac-Toe Game](https://github.com/doctatrey/tic-tac-toe-game)
Classic two-player game with win detection algorithm. Tracks board state, validates moves, and detects all win conditions (rows, columns, diagonals) and draw scenarios.
